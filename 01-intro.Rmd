## Installing and loading libraries

To run the `FLa4a` methods the reader will need to install the package and its dependencies and load them. Some datasets are distributed with the package and as such need to be loaded too.

```{eval=FALSE}
# from CRAN
install.packages(c("copula","triangle", "coda", "grid", "gridExtra", "latticeExtra"))
# from FLR
install.packages(c("FLCore", "FLa4a"), repos="http://flr-project.org/R")
```

```{message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# libraries
library(devtools)
library(FLa4a)
library(XML)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplotFL)
# datasets
data(ple4)
data(ple4.indices)
data(ple4.index)
data(rfLen)
```

```
packageVersion("FLCore")
packageVersion("FLa4a")
```

## How to read this document

The target audience for this document are readers with some experience in R and some background on stock assessment.

The document explains the approach being developed by \aFa for fish stock assessment and scientific advice. It presents a mixture of text and code, where the first explains the concepts behind the methods, while the last shows how these can be run with the software provided. Moreover, having the code allows the reader to copy/paste and replicate the analysis presented here.

The sections and subsections are as independent as possible, so it can be used as a reference document for the `FLa4a`. 

## Notation

Along this chapter the notation presented in Table~\@ref(tbl-mathsnotation) will be used. Mathematical descriptions will be kept as simple as possible for readability.
