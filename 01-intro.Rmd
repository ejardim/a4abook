# Introduction

The a4a stock assessment framework is based in a non-linear catch-at-age model implemented in `R`, `FLR` and `ADMB` that can be applied rapidly to a wide range of situations with low setup requirements.

The framework is built of submodels which define the different parts of a statistical catch at age model that require structural assumptions. In the a4a framework these are fishing mortality-at-age, abundance indicies catchability-at-age, recruitment, observation variances of catch-at-age and abundance indices-at-age, and abundance-at-age in the first year of the data series (see section \@ref{sec:math} for details).

Other important processes, like natural mortality, individual growth and reproduction, are treated as fixed, as it's common in stock assessment methods. Nevertheless, the a4a framework provides methods to condition these processes prior to the model fit, and propagate their uncertainty into the assessment process. See chapters XX and section XX.

The submodels formulation uses linear models, which opens the possibility of using the linear modelling tools available in `R`. For example, [`mgcv`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html) gam formulas or factorial design formulas using `lm()`.

The 'language' of linear models has been developing within the statistical community for many years, and constitutes an elegant way of defining models without going through the complexity of mathematical representations. This approach makes it also easier to communicate among scientists:
