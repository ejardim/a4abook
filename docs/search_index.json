The framework is built of submodels which define the different parts of a statistical catch at age model that require structural assumptions. In the a4a framework these are fishing mortality-at-age, abundance indicies catchability-at-age, recruitment, observation variances of catch-at-age and abundance indices-at-age, and abundance-at-age in the first year of the data series (see section @ref{sec:math} for details). Other important processes, like natural mortality, individual growth and reproduction, are treated as fixed, as it’s common in stock assessment methods. Nevertheless, the a4a framework provides methods to condition these processes prior to the model fit, and propagate their uncertainty into the assessment process. See chapters XX and section XX. The submodels formulation uses linear models, which opens the possibility of using the linear modelling tools available in R. For example, mgcv gam formulas or factorial design formulas using lm(). The ‘language’ of linear models has been developing within the statistical community for many years, and constitutes an elegant way of defining models without going through the complexity of mathematical representations. This approach makes it also easier to communicate among scientists: J. A.

It presents a mixture of text and code, where the first explains the concepts behind the methods, while the last shows how these can be run with the software provided.} 3.1 Background The a4a stock assessment framework is based on age dynamics. Therefore, to use length information it must be processed before it can be used in an assessment. The rationale is that the processing should give the analyst the flexibility to use a range of sources of information, literature or online databases, to grab information about the species growth model and the uncertainty about the model parameters. Within the a4a framework this is handled using the a4aGr class. In this section we introduce the a4aGr class and look at the variety of ways that parameter uncertainty can be included. 3.2 a4aGr - The growth class The conversion of length data to age is performed through the use of a growth model. The implementation is done through the a4aGr class. showClass(&quot;a4aGr&quot;) ## Class &quot;a4aGr&quot; [package &quot;FLa4a&quot;] ## ## Slots: ## ## Name: grMod grInvMod params vcov distr name desc ## Class: formula formula FLPar array character character character ## ## Name: range ## Class: numeric ## ## Extends: &quot;FLComp&quot; To construct an a4aGr object, the growth model and parameters must be provided. Check the help file for more information. Here we show an example using the von Bertalanffy growth model. To create the a4aGr object it’s necessary to pass the model equation (\\(length \\sim time\\)), the inverse model equation (\\(time \\sim length\\)) and the parameters. Any growth model can be used as long as it’s possible to write the model (and the inverse) as an R formula. vbObj &lt;- a4aGr( grMod=~linf*(1-exp(-k*(t-t0))), grInvMod=~t0-1/k*log(1-len/linf), params=FLPar(linf=58.5, k=0.086, t0=0.001, units=c(&quot;cm&quot;,&quot;year-1&quot;,&quot;year&quot;)) ) # Check the model and its inverse lc=20 predict(vbObj, len=lc) ## iter ## 1 ## 1 4.86575 predict(vbObj, t=predict(vbObj, len=lc))==lc ## iter ## 1 ## 1 TRUE The predict method allows the transformation between age and lengths using the growth model. predict(vbObj, len=5:10+0.5) ## iter ## 1 ## 1 1.149080 ## 2 1.370570 ## 3 1.596362 ## 4 1.826625 ## 5 2.061540 ## 6 2.301299 predict(vbObj, t=5:10+0.5) ## iter ## 1 ## 1 22.04376 ## 2 25.04796 ## 3 27.80460 ## 4 30.33408 ## 5 32.65511 ## 6 34.78488 3.3 Adding uncertainty to growth parameters with a multivariate normal distribution} Uncertainty in the growth model is introduced through the inclusion of parameter uncertainty. This is done by making use of the parameter variance-covariance matrix (the vcov slot of the a4aGr class) and assuming a distribution. The numbers in the variance-covariance matrix could come from the parameter uncertainty from fitting the growth model parameters. Here we set the variance-covariance matrix by scaling a correlation matrix, using a cv of 0.2.

(#fig:plot_mv_growth)Growth curves using parameters simulated from a multivariate normal distribution. 3.4 Adding uncertainty to growth parameters with a multivariate triangle distribution} One alternative to using a normal distribution is to use a triangle distribution. We use the package triangle where this distribution is parametrized using the minimum, maximum and median values. This can be very attractive if the analyst needs to scrape information from the web or literature and perform some kind of meta-analysis. Here we show an example of setting a triangle distribution with values taken from Fishbase. # The web address for the growth parameters for redfish (Sebastes norvegicus) addr &lt;- &quot;https://fishbase.se/PopDyn/PopGrowthList.php?ID=501&quot; # Scrape the data tab &lt;- try(readHTMLTable(addr)) ## Error : XML content does not seem to be XML: &#39;&#39; # Load local copy if no web if(is(tab, &quot;try-error&quot;)) load(&quot;data/tab.RData&quot;) # Interrogate the data table and get vectors of the values linf &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(tab$dataTable[,2])) k &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(tab$dataTable[,4])) t0 &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(tab$dataTable[,5])) # Set the min (a), max (b) and median (c) values for the parameter as a list of lists # Note that t0 has no &#39;c&#39; (median) value. This makes the distribution symmetrical triPars &lt;- list(list(a=min(linf), b=max(linf), c=median(linf)), list(a=min(k), b=max(k), c=median(k)), list(a=median(t0, na.rm=T)-IQR(t0, na.rm=T)/2, b=median(t0, na.rm=T)+ IQR(t0, na.rm=T)/2)) # Simulate 10000 times using mvrtriangle vbTri &lt;- mvrtriangle(10000, vbObj, paramMargins=triPars) The marginals will reflect the uncertainty on the parameter values that were scraped from Fishbase but, as we don’t really believe the parameters are multivariate normal, here we adopted a distribution based on a t copula with triangle marginals. The marginal distributions can be seen in Figure @ref(fig:plot_tri_params) and the shape of the correlation can be seen in Figure @ref(fig:plot_tri_scatter). (#fig:plot_tri_params)The marginal distributions of each of the parameters from using a multivariate triangle distribution. (#fig:plot_tri_scatter)Scatter plot of the 10000 samples parameter from the multivariate triangle distribution. We can still use predict() to see the growth model uncertainty (Figure @ref(fig:plot_tri_growth)). (#fig:plot_tri_growth)Growth curves using parameters simulated from a multivariate triangle distribution. Remember that the above examples use a variance-covariance matrix that we essentially made up. An alternative would be to scrape the entire growth parameters dataset from Fishbase and compute the shape of the variance-covariance matrix yourself. 3.5 Adding uncertainty to growth parameters with statistical copulas} A more general approach to adding parameter uncertainty is to make use of statistical copulas and marginal distributions of choice. This is possible with the mvrcop() function borrowed from the package copula. The example below keeps the same parameters and changes only the copula type and family but a lot more can be done. Check the package copula for more information. % Needs more explanation vbCop &lt;- mvrcop(10000, vbObj, copula=&quot;archmCopula&quot;, family=&quot;clayton&quot;, param=2, margins=&quot;triangle&quot;, paramMargins=triPars) The shape of the correlation changes (Figure @ref(fig:plot_cop_tri_scatter)) as well as the resulting growth curves (Figure @ref(fig:plot_cop_tri_growth)).

(#fig:plot_cop_tri_growth)Growth curves from the using an archmCopula copula with triangle margins. 3.6 Converting from length to age based data - the l2a() method} After introducing uncertainty in the growth model through the parameters it’s time to transform the length-based dataset into an age-based dataset. The method that deals with this process is l2a(). The implementation of this method for the FLQuant class is the main workhorse. There are two other implementations, for the FLStock and FLIndex classes, which are mainly wrappers that call the FLQuant method several times. When converting from length-based data to age-based data you need to be aware of how the aggregation of length classes is performed. For example, individuals in length classes 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 cm may all be considered as being of age 1 (obviously depending on the growth model). How should the values in those length classes be combined? If the values are abundances then the values should be summed. Summing other types of values, such as mean weight, does not make sense. Instead these values are averaged over the length classes (possibly weighted by the abundance). This is controlled using the stat argument which can be either mean or sum (the default). Fishing mortality is not computed to avoid making wrong assumptions about the meaning of F at length. We demonstrate the method by converting a catch-at-length FLQuant to a catch-at-age FLQuant. First we make an a4aGr object with a multivariate triangle distribution (using the parameters we set above). We use 10 iterations as an example. And call l2a() by passing in the length-based FLQuant and the a4aGr object. vbTriSmall &lt;- mvrtriangle(10, vbObj, paramMargins=triPars) cth.n &lt;- l2a(catch.n(rfLen.stk), vbTriSmall) ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced ## Warning in log(1 - len/linf): NaNs produced dim(cth.n) ## [1] 68 26 1 4 1 10 In the previous example, the FLQuant object that was sliced (catch.n(rfLen.stk)) had only one iteration. This iteration was sliced by each of the iterations in the growth model. It is possible for the FLQuant object to have the same number of iterations as the growth model, in which case each iteration of the FLQuant and the growth model are used together. It is also possible for the growth model to have only one iteration while the FLQuant object has many iterations. The same growth model is then used for each of the FLQuant iterations. As with all FLR objects, the general rule is one or n iterations. As well as converting one FLQuant at a time, we can convert entire FLStock and FLIndex objects. In these cases the individual FLQuant slots of those classes are converted from length-based to age-based. As mentioned above, the aggregation method depends on the type of values the slots contain. The abundance slots (*.n, such as stock.n) are summed. The *.wt, m, mat, harvest.spwn and m.spwn slots of an FLStock object are averaged. The catch.wt and sel.pattern slots of an FLIndex object are averaged, while the index, index.var and catch.n slots are summed. The method for FLStock classes takes an additional argument for the plusgroup. aStk &lt;- l2a(rfLen.stk, vbTriSmall, plusgroup=14) ## Warning in .local(object, model, ...): Individual weights, M and maturity will be (weighted) averaged accross lengths, ## harvest is not computed and everything else will be summed. ## If this is not what you want, you&#39;ll have to deal with these slots by hand. ## Warning in .local(object, model, ...): Some ages are less than 0, indicating a mismatch between input data lengths ## and growth parameters (possibly t0) ## Warning in .local(object, model, ...): Trimming age range to a minimum of 0 ## [1] &quot;maxfbar has been changed to accomodate new plusgroup&quot; aIdx &lt;- l2a(rfTrawl.idx, vbTriSmall) ## Warning in l2a(rfTrawl.idx, vbTriSmall): Some ages are less than 0, indicating a mismatch between input data lengths ## and growth parameters (possibly t0) ## Warning in l2a(rfTrawl.idx, vbTriSmall): Trimming age range to a minimum of 0 When converting with l2a() all lengths above Linf are converted to the maximum age, as there is no information in the growth model about how to deal with individuals larger than Linf.

It presents a mixture of text and code, where the first explains the concepts behind the methods, while the last shows how these can be run with the software provided. 4.1 Background In the a4a natural mortality is dealt with as an external parameter to the stock assessment model. The rationale to modelling natural mortality is similar to that of growth: one should be able to grab information from a range of sources and feed it into the assessment. The mechanism used by a4a is to build an interface that makes it transparent, flexible and hopefully easy to explore different options. In relation to natural mortality it means that the analyst should be able to use distinct models like Gislasson’s, Charnov’s, Pauly’s, etc in a coherent framework making it possible to compare the outcomes of the assessment. Within the a4a framework, the general method for inserting natural mortality in the stock assessment is to: Create an object of class a4aM which holds the natural mortality model and parameters. Add uncertainty to the parameters in the a4aM object. Apply the m() method to the a4aM object to create an age or length based FLQuant object of the required dimensions. The resulting FLQuant object can then be directly inserted into an FLStock object to be used for the assessment. In this section we go through each of the steps in detail using a variety of different models. 4.2 a4aM - The M class Natural mortality is implemented in a class named a4aM. This class is made up of three objects of the class FLModelSim. Each object is a model that represents one effect: an age or length effect, a scaling (level) effect and a time trend, named shape, level and trend, respectively. The impact of the models is multiplicative, i.e. the overal natural mortality is given by shape x level x trend. Check the help files for more information. showClass(&quot;a4aM&quot;) ## Class &quot;a4aM&quot; [package &quot;FLa4a&quot;] ## ## Slots: ## ## Name: shape level trend name desc range ## Class: FLModelSim FLModelSim FLModelSim character character numeric ## ## Extends: &quot;FLComp&quot; The a4aM constructor requires that the models and parameters are provided. The default method will build each of these models as a constant value of 1. As a simple example, the usual “0.2” guessestimate could be set up by setting the level model to have a single parameter with a fixed value, while the other two models, shape and trend, have a default value of 1 (meaning that they have no effect). mod02 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~a, params=FLPar(a=0.2)) m1 &lt;- a4aM(level=mod02) m1 ## a4aM object: ## shape: ~1 ## level: ~a ## trend: ~1 More interesting natural mortality shapes can be set up using biological knowledge. The following example uses an exponential decay over ages (implying that the resulting FLQuant} generated by the m() method will be age based). We also use Jensen’s second estimator (Kenchington, 2014) as a scaling level model, which is based on the von Bertalanffy \\(K\\) parameter, \\(M=1.5K\\). shape2 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~exp(-age-0.5)) level2 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~1.5*k, params=FLPar(k=0.4)) m2 &lt;- a4aM(shape=shape2, level=level2) m2 ## a4aM object: ## shape: ~exp(-age - 0.5) ## level: ~1.5 * k ## trend: ~1 Note that the shape model has age as a parameter of the model but is not set using the params argument. The shape model does not have to be age-based. For example, here we set up a shape model using Gislason’s second estimator (Kenshington, 2013): \\(M_l=K(\\frac{L_{\\inf}}{l})^{1.5}\\). We use the default level and trend models. % Current m() method is not ideal for length based methods as you cannot specify length range and half-widths to make compatible with FLStockLen shape_len &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~K*(linf/len)^1.5, params=FLPar(linf=60, K=0.4)) m_len &lt;- a4aM(shape=shape_len) Another option is to model how an external factor may impact the natural mortality. This can be added through the trend model. Suppose natural mortality can be modelled with a dependency on the NAO index, due to some mechanism that results in having lower mortality when NAO is negative and higher when it’s positive. In this example, the impact is represented by the NAO value on the quarter before spawning, which occurs in the second quarter. We use this to make a complicated natural mortality model with an age based shape model, a level model based on \\(K\\) and a trend model driven by NAO, where mortality increases by 50% if NAO is positive on the first quarter. # Get NAO nao &lt;- read.table(&quot;https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/norm.nao.monthly.b5001.current.ascii.table&quot;, skip=1, fill=TRUE, na.strings=&quot;-99.90&quot;) dnms &lt;- list(quant=&quot;nao&quot;, year=1950:2024, unit=&quot;unique&quot;, season=1:12, area=&quot;unique&quot;) # Build an FLQuant from the NAO data nao.flq &lt;- FLQuant(unlist(nao[,-1]), dimnames=dnms, units=&quot;nao&quot;) # Build covar by calculating mean over the first 3 months nao &lt;- seasonMeans(trim(nao.flq, year=dimnames(stock.n(ple4))$year)) # Turn into Boolean nao &lt;- (nao&gt;0) # Constructor trend3 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~1+b*nao, params=FLPar(b=0.5)) shape3 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~exp(-age-0.5)) level3 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~1.5*k, params=FLPar(k=0.4)) m3 &lt;- a4aM(shape=shape3, level=level3, trend=trend3) m3 ## a4aM object: ## shape: ~exp(-age - 0.5) ## level: ~1.5 * k ## trend: ~1 + b * nao 4.3 Adding uncertainty to natural mortality parameters with a multivariate normal distribution Uncertainty on natural mortality is added through uncertainty on the parameters. In this section we’ll’ show how to add multivariate normal uncertainty. We make use of the class FLModelSim method mvrnorm(), which is a wrapper for the method mvrnorm() distributed by the package MASS. We’ll create an a4aM object with an exponential shape, a level model based on \\(k\\) and temperature (Jensen’s third estimator), and a trend model driven by the NAO (as above). Afterwards a variance-covariance matrix for the level and trend models will be included. Finally, create an object with 100 iterations using the mvrnorm() method. Create the object: shape4 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~exp(-age-0.5)) level4 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~k^0.66*t^0.57, params=FLPar(k=0.4, t=10), vcov=array(c(0.002, 0.01,0.01, 1), dim=c(2,2))) trend4 &lt;- FLModelSim(model=~1+b*nao, params=FLPar(b=0.5), vcov=matrix(0.02)) m4 &lt;- a4aM(shape=shape4, level=level4, trend=trend4) # Call mvrnorm() m4 &lt;- mvrnorm(100, m4) m4 ## a4aM object: ## shape: ~exp(-age - 0.5) ## level: ~k^0.66 * t^0.57 ## trend: ~1 + b * nao Inspect the level model (for example): m4@level ## An object of class &quot;FLModelSim&quot; ## Slot &quot;model&quot;: ## ~k^0.66 * t^0.57 ## ## Slot &quot;params&quot;: ## An object of class &quot;FLPar&quot; ## iters: 100 ## ## params ## k t ## 0.40833(0.0476) 10.30841(0.7911) ## units: NA ## ## Slot &quot;vcov&quot;: ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.002 0.01 ## [2,] 0.010 1.00 ## ## Slot &quot;distr&quot;: ## [1] &quot;norm&quot; Note the variance in the parameters: params(trend(m4)) ## An object of class &quot;FLPar&quot; ## iters: 100 ## ## params ## b ## 0.47405(0.136) ## units: NA Note the shape model has no parameters and no uncertainty: params(shape(m4)) ## An object of class &quot;FLPar&quot; ## params ## ## NA ## units: NA In this particular case, the shape model will not be randomized because it doesn’t have a variance-covariance matrix.

We now have a new model that can be used for the shape model. You can use the constructor or the set method to add the new model. Note that we have a quite complex method now for M.

For that we need the m() method. The m() method is the workhorse method for computing natural mortality. The method returns an FLQuant that can be inserted in an FLStock for usage by the assessment method. %The method uses the range slot to work out the dimensions of the FLQuant object. % Future developments will also allow for easy insertion into FLStockLen objects. The size of the FLQuant object is determined by the min, max, minyear and maxyear elements of the range slot of the a4aM object. By default the values of these elements are set to 0. Giving an FLQuant with length 1 in the quant and year dimension. The range slot can be set by hand, or by using the rngquant() and rngyear() methods. The name of the first dimension of the output FLQuant (e.g. ‘age’ or ‘len’) is determined by the parameters of the shape model. If it is not clear what the name should be then the name is set to ‘quant’. Here we demonstrate m() using the simple a4aM object we created above that has constant natural mortality.

As the shape model has ‘age’ as a variable which is not included in the FLPar slot it is used as the name of the first dimension of the resulting FLQuant. Note that in this case the mbar values in the range become relevant, once that mbar is used to compute the mean level. This mean level will match the value given by the level model. The mbar range can be changed with the rngmbar() method. We illustrate this by making an FLQuant with age varying natural mortality. Check the model and set the ranges: m2 ## a4aM object: ## shape: ~exp(-age - 0.5) ## level: ~1.5 * k ## trend: ~1 range(m2, c(&quot;min&quot;,&quot;max&quot;)) &lt;- c(0,7) # set the quant range range(m2, c(&quot;minyear&quot;,&quot;maxyear&quot;)) &lt;- c(2000, 2003) # set the year range range(m2) ## min max plusgroup minyear maxyear minmbar maxmbar ## 0 7 0 2000 2003 0 0 m(m2) ## An object of class &quot;FLQuant&quot; ## , , unit = unique, season = all, area = unique ## ## year ## age 2000 2001 2002 2003 ## 0 0.60000000 0.60000000 0.60000000 0.60000000 ## 1 0.22072766 0.22072766 0.22072766 0.22072766 ## 2 0.08120117 0.08120117 0.08120117 0.08120117 ## 3 0.02987224 0.02987224 0.02987224 0.02987224 ## 4 0.01098938 0.01098938 0.01098938 0.01098938 ## 5 0.00404277 0.00404277 0.00404277 0.00404277 ## 6 0.00148725 0.00148725 0.00148725 0.00148725 ## 7 0.00054713 0.00054713 0.00054713 0.00054713 ## ## units: NA Note that the level value is: predict(level(m2)) ## iter ## 1 ## 1 0.6 Which is the same as: m(m2)[&quot;0&quot;] ## An object of class &quot;FLQuant&quot; ## , , unit = unique, season = all, area = unique ## ## year ## age 2000 2001 2002 2003 ## 0 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 ## ## units: NA This is because the mbar range is currently set to “0” and “0” (see above) and the mean natural mortality value over this range is given by the level model.

"],["stock-assessment-framework.html", "Chapter 5 Stock assessment framework 5.1 Maths description 5.2 Classes description ", " Chapter 5 Stock assessment framework 5.1 Maths description The stock assessment model behind the framework is based in two main equations to link observations to processes, the Baranov’s catch equation and abundance indices equation. Catches in numbers by age and year are defined in terms of the three quantities: natural mortality, fishing mortality and recruitment; using a modified form of the well known Baranov catch equation: \\[C_{ay} = \\frac{F_{ay}}{F_{ay}+M_{ay}}\\left(1 - e^{-(F_{ay}+M_{ay})}\\right) R_{y}e^{-\\sum (F_{ay} + M_{ay})} \\] Survey indices by age and year are defined in terms of the same three quantities with the addition of survey catchability: \\[I_{ays} = Q_{ays} R_{y}e^{-\\sum (F_{ay} + M_{ay})}\\] Observed catches and observed survey indices are assumed to be log-normally distributed, or equivalently, normally distributed on the log-scale, with specific observation variance: \\[ \\log \\hat{C}_{ay} \\sim \\text{Normal} \\Big( \\log C_{ay}, \\sigma^2_{ay}\\Big) \\] \\[ \\log \\hat{I}_{ays} \\sim \\text{Normal} \\Big( \\log I_{ays}, \\tau^2_{ays} \\Big) \\] The log-likelihood can now be defined as the sum of the log-likelihood of the observed catches: \\[ \\ell_C = \\sum_{ay} w^{(c)}_{ay}\\ \\ell_N \\Big( \\log C_{ay}, \\sigma^2_{ay} ;\\ \\log \\hat{C}_{ay} \\Big) \\] and the log-likelihood of the observed survey indices as: \\[ \\ell_I = \\sum_s \\sum_{ay} w^{(s)}_{ays}\\ \\ell_N \\Big( \\log I_{ays}, \\tau_{ays}^2 ;\\ \\log \\hat{I}_{ays} \\Big)\\] giving the total log-likelihood \\[\\ell = \\ell_C + \\ell_I\\] which is defined in terms of the strictly positive quantites, \\(M_{ay}\\), \\(F_{ay}\\), \\(Q_{ays}\\) and \\(R_{y}\\), and the observation variances \\(\\sigma_{ay}\\) and \\(\\tau_{ays}\\). As such, the log-likelihood is over-parameterised as there are many more parameters than observations. In order to reduce the number of parameters, \\(M_{ay}\\) is assumed known (as is common). %==================================================================== %THE FOLLOWING NEEDS REVISION, need to bring in N1 submod %==================================================================== The remaining parameters are written in terms of a linear combination of covariates \\(x_{ayk}\\), e.g. \\[\\log F_{ay} = \\sum_k \\beta_k x_{ayk}\\] where \\(k\\) is the number of parameters to be estimated and is sufficiently small.

The following section has more discussion on the use of linear models in a4a. %==================================================================== The a4a statistical catch-at-age model can addionally allow for a functional relationship that links predicted recruitment \\(\\tilde{R}\\) based on spawning stock biomass and modelled recruitment \\(R\\), to be imposed as a fixed variance random effect. [NEEDS REVISION, sentence not clear] Options for the relationship are the hard coded models Ricker, Beverton Holt, smooth hockeystick or geometric mean. This is implemented by including a third component in the log-likelihood: \\[\\ell_{SR} = \\sum_y \\ell_N \\Big( \\log \\tilde{R}_y(a, b), \\phi_y^2 ;\\ \\log R_y \\Big)\\] giving the total log-likelihood \\[\\ell = \\ell_C + \\ell_I + \\ell_{SR}\\] Using the (time varying) Ricker model as an example, predicted recruitment is \\[\\tilde{R}_y(a_y,b_y) = a_y S_{y-1} e^{-b_y S_{y-1}}\\] where \\(S\\) is spawning stock biomass derived from the model parameters \\(F\\) and \\(R\\), and the fixed quantites \\(M\\) and mean weights by year and age. It is assumed that \\(R\\) is log-normally distributed, or equivalently, normally distributed on the log-scale about the (log) recruitment predicted by the SR model \\(\\tilde{R}\\), with known variance \\(\\phi^2\\), i.e. \\[\\log R_y \\sim \\text{Normal} \\Big( \\log \\tilde{R}_y, \\phi_y^2 \\Big)\\] which leads to the definition of \\(\\ell_{SR}\\) given above. In all cases \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are strictly positive, and with the quantities \\(F\\), \\(R\\), etc. linear models are used to parameterise \\(\\log a\\) and/or \\(\\log b\\), where relevant. %==================================================================== %THE FOLLOWING NEEDS REVISION, this is not just the default I guess, % it’s always present since R predictions will be a mix of S/R and \\(\\gamma\\) %==================================================================== By default, recruitment \\(R\\) as apposed to the reruitment predicted from a stock recruitment model \\(\\tilde{R}\\), is specified as a linear model with a parameter for each year, i.e. \\[\\log R_y = \\gamma_y\\] This is to allow modelled recruitment \\(R_y\\) to be shrunk towards the stock recruitment model. However, if it is considered appropriate that recruitment can be determined exactly by a relationship with covariates, it is possible, to instead define \\(\\log R\\) in terms of a linear model in the same way as \\(\\log F\\), \\(\\log Q\\), \\(\\log \\sigma\\) and \\(\\log \\tau\\). %But this is pretty much the same as taking a geometric mean, with a model on log a, and making the variance very small. %==================================================================== % WE NEED TO ADD SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE PLUSGROUP IS MODELLED %==================================================================== 5.2 Classes description Figure 5.1 shows the process to fit a statistical stock assessment catch at age method.

Both classes have the same structure "],["submodel-structure.html", "Chapter 6 Submodel structure 6.1 Submodel building blocks and fundamental R formulas 6.2 The major effects available for modelling 6.3 The submodel class and methods", " Chapter 6 Submodel structure The a4a stock assessment framework allows the user to set up a large number of different models. The mechanics which provide this flexibility are designed around the concept of submodels. Each unknown variable that must be estimated is treated as a linear model, for which the user has to define the model structure using R formulas, including mgcv gam formulas. All submodels use the same specification process, the R formula interface, wich gives lot’s of flexibility to explore models and combination of submodels. There are 5 submodels in operation: a model for F-at-age (\\(F_{ay}\\)) a (list) of model(s) for abundance indices catchability-at-age (\\(Q_{ays}\\)), a model for recruitment (\\(R_y\\)) a list of models for the observation variance of catch-at-age and abundance indices (\\(\\{\\sigma^2_{ay}, \\tau^2_{ays}\\}\\)) a model for the initial age structure \\(N_{a,y=1}\\), When setting the structure of each submodel the user is in fact building the predictive model and its parameters. The optimization process, done through ADMB, estimates the parameters and their variance-covariance matrix, allowing further analysis to be carried out, like simulation, prediction, diagnostics, etc. All the statistical machinery will be at the user’s reach. 6.1 Submodel building blocks and fundamental R formulas The elements available to build submodels formulas are ‘age’ and ‘year’, which can be used to build models with different structures. In R’s linear modelling language, a constant model is coded as $ 1$, while a slope over time would simply be \\(\\sim year\\), a smoother over time \\(\\sim s(year, k=10)\\), a model with a coefficient for each year would be \\(\\sim factor(year)\\). Transformations of the variables are as usual, e.g. \\(\\sim sqrt(year)\\), etc; while combinations of all the above can be done although non-convergence will limit the possibilities. Using the \\(F\\) submodel as example the following specifies the models described in the previous paragraph: # models m1 &lt;- ~1 m2 &lt;- ~ year m3 &lt;- ~ s(year, k=10) m4 &lt;- ~ factor(year) m5 &lt;- ~ sqrt(year) # fits fit1 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m1, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m2, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit3 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m3, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit4 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m4, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit5 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m5, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) # plot lst &lt;- FLStocks(constant=ple4+fit1, linear=ple4+fit2, smooth=ple4+fit3, factor=ple4+fit4, sqrt=ple4+fit5) lst &lt;- lapply(lst, fbar) lgnd &lt;- list(points=FALSE, lines=TRUE, space=&#39;right&#39;) xyplot(data~year, groups=qname, lst, auto.key=lgnd, type=&#39;l&#39;, ylab=&#39;fishing mortality&#39;) (#fig:fund_forms)Example of fundamental R formulas The models above and their combinations can be used to model both ‘age’ and ‘year’. The corresponding fits for age are: # models m1 &lt;- ~1 m2 &lt;- ~ age m3 &lt;- ~ s(age, k=3) m4 &lt;- ~ factor(age) m5 &lt;- ~ sqrt(age) # fits fit1 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m1, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m2, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit3 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m3, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit4 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m4, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) fit5 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=m5, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) # plot lst &lt;- FLStocks(constant=ple4+fit1, linear=ple4+fit2, smooth=ple4+fit3, factor=ple4+fit4, sqrt=ple4+fit5) lst &lt;- lapply(lst, function(x) harvest(x)[,&#39;2000&#39;]) xyplot(data~age, groups=qname, lst, auto.key=lgnd, type=&#39;l&#39;, ylab=&#39;fishing mortality in 2000&#39;) (#fig:fund_forms_age)Example of fundamental R formulas 6.2 The major effects available for modelling Although the building blocks for formulas are ‘age’ and ‘year’, in fact there are three effects that can be modelled for each submodel: ‘age’, ‘year’ and ‘cohort’. As examples note the following models for fishing mortality. # the age effect ageeffect &lt;- ~ factor(age) # the year effect yeareffect &lt;- ~ factor(year) # the cohort cohorteffect &lt;- ~ factor(year-age) # the fits fit1 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=yeareffect) fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=ageeffect) fit3 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=cohorteffect) and the graphical representation of the three models in Figures 6.1 to 6.3. wireframe(harvest(fit1), main=&#39;year effect&#39;) Figure 6.1: Major effects: the year effect (~ factor(year)) wireframe(harvest(fit2), main=&#39;age effect&#39;) Figure 6.2: Major effects: the age effect (~ factor(age)) wireframe(harvest(fit3), main=&#39;cohort effect&#39;) Figure 6.3: Major effects: the cohort effect (~ factor(year-age)) 6.3 The submodel class and methods %==================================================================== % COLIN TO CHECK THE SECTION %==================================================================== Although the specification of each submodel is done through a R formula, internally the a4a sca fit creates an object (of class ‘submodel’) which stores more information and allows a wide number of methods to be applied. The most important cases are prediction and simulation methods. The submodel class is a S4 class with the following slots: showClass(&quot;submodel&quot;) ## Class &quot;submodel&quot; [package &quot;FLa4a&quot;] ## ## Slots: ## ## Name: formula coefficients vcov centering distr ## Class: formula FLPar array FLPar character ## ## Name: link linkinv name desc range ## Class: function function character character numeric ## ## Extends: &quot;FLComp&quot; Objects of class ‘submodel’ are created in the fitting process using the formulas set by the user (or defaults if missing) and information from the fit. For example begining with a simple a4a fit: # fit a model with indices &quot;IBTS_Q1&quot; and &quot;IBTS_Q3&quot; fit0 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[c(&quot;IBTS_Q1&quot;, &quot;IBTS_Q3&quot;)], fmodel = ~ s(age, k = 5), qmodel = list( ~ s(age, k = 4), ~ s(age, k = 4)), srmodel = ~ 1, n1model = ~ s(age, k = 5), vmodel = list( ~ 1, ~ 1, ~ 1), verbose = FALSE) fit0 ## a4a model fit for: PLE ## ## Call: ## .local(stock = stock, indices = indices, fmodel = ..1, qmodel = ..2, ## srmodel = ..3, n1model = ..4, vmodel = ..5, verbose = FALSE) ## ## Time used: ## Pre-processing Running a4a Post-processing Total ## 0.22117448 0.48696613 0.03530979 0.74345040 ## ## Submodels: ## fmodel: ~s(age, k = 5) ## srmodel: ~1 ## n1model: ~s(age, k = 5) ## qmodel: ## IBTS_Q1: ~s(age, k = 4) ## IBTS_Q3: ~s(age, k = 4) ## vmodel: ## catch: ~1 ## IBTS_Q1: ~1 ## IBTS_Q3: ~1 Within the sca fit object there’s a collection of submodels for each component of the a4a stock assessment model (fishing mortality, survey catchability, stock recruitment relationship, initial population and the observation variance for catch numbers and survey indices). For readability the following example will use the fishing mortality submodel although the methods and models described can be applied to each of the 5 submodels. The submodel can be extracted using: fmod &lt;- fmodel(fit0) inside this object is a formula, the coeficients estimated by the model and their covariance matrix. coef(fmod) vcov(fmod) it is also possible to get the data behind the fit and the design matrix required to get the fitted values as.data.frame(fmod) getX(fmod) this makes it possble to check the fit manually like this (note that the data is centered in the model, which is addressed by adding the centering after the prediction is made, see code below): dat &lt;- as.data.frame(fmod) X &lt;- getX(fmod) b &lt;- coef(fmod) dat$fit &lt;- exp(c(X %*% b))# + dat$data.centering) plot(fit ~ age, type = &quot;l&quot;, data = dat[dat$year == 2016,], ylab = &quot;Estimated fishing mortality at age&quot;, ylim = c(0, max(dat$fit)), las = 1) or simulate from the fit by resampling based on the variance matrix of the coefficients, which is done by simulating many coefficients (here called bsim). # get the variance matrix of the coefficients and simulate Sigma &lt;- vcov(fmod)[,,1] bsim &lt;- mvrnorm(999, b, Sigma) fit_sim &lt;- exp(X %*% bsim) dat$ci_lower &lt;- apply(fit_sim, 1, quantile, p = 0.025) dat$ci_upper &lt;- apply(fit_sim, 1, quantile, p = 0.975) plot(fit ~ age, type = &quot;l&quot;, data = dat[dat$year == 2016,], ylab = &quot;Estimated fishing mortality at age&quot;, ylim = c(0, max(dat$ci_upper)), las = 1) lines(ci_lower ~ age, data = dat[dat$year == 2016,], lty = 2) lines(ci_upper ~ age, data = dat[dat$year == 2016,], lty = 2) The above code is to show how it is possible to use an FLa4a submodel to predict and simulate, and not intended to be used by the user. The recomended way to predict from a submodel and make simulations is to use the genFLQuant function (and for finer control, there is also a simulate function). The above example can be done using FLa4a functions as follows: fmod_fit &lt;- genFLQuant(fmod) dat &lt;- as.data.frame(fmod_fit) plot(data ~ age, type = &quot;l&quot;, data = dat[dat$year == 2016,], ylab = &quot;Estimated fishing mortality at age&quot;, ylim = c(0, max(dat$data)), las = 1) or using the ggplotFL package: fmod_fit &lt;- genFLQuant(fmod) ggplot(data = fmod_fit[,&quot;2016&quot;], aes(x = age, y = data)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + ylab(&quot;Estimated fishing mortality at age&quot;) + ylim(0, max(fmod_fit)) and the simulations and confidence intervals are easily computed: # simulate 999 fmod_fit_sim &lt;- genFLQuant(fmod, nsim = 999) # reduce to quantiles fmod_fit_sim &lt;- quantile(fmod_fit_sim[,&quot;2016&quot;], c(0.025, 0.50, 0.975)) plotting can be done by converting to a data.frame, reshaping and using standard ggplot2 functionality dat &lt;- reshape( as.data.frame(fmod_fit_sim, drop=TRUE), timevar = &quot;iter&quot;, idvar = &quot;age&quot;, direction = &quot;wide&quot; ) ggplot(data=dat, aes(x = age, y = `data.50%`)) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `data.2.5%`, ymax = `data.97.5%`), fill=&quot;red&quot;, alpha = .15) + geom_point() + geom_line() + ylab(&quot;Estimated fishing mortality at age&quot;) + ylim(0, max(fmod_fit_sim)) "],["fitting.html", "Chapter 7 Fitting 7.1 Fishing mortality submodel (\\(F_{ay}\\)) 7.2 Abundance indices catchability submodel (\\(Q_{ays}\\)) 7.3 Stock-recruitment submodel (\\(R_y\\))} 7.4 Observation variance submodel (\\(\\{\\sigma^2_{ay}, \\tau^2_{ays}\\}\\)) 7.5 Initial year abundance submodel (\\(N_{a,y=1}\\))} 7.6 Data weigthing 7.7 Working with covariates 7.8 Assessing files 7.9 Missing observations in the catch matrix or index", " Chapter 7 Fitting The a4a stock assessment framework is implemented in R through the method sca(). The method call requires as a minimum a FLStock object and a FLIndices object, in which case the default submodels will be set by the method. Having described building blocks, basic formulations and effects available to build a submodel’s model, it’s important to look into specific formulations and relate them to commonly known representations. Note that although a large number of formulations are available for each submodel, the user must carefuly decide on the full stock assessment model being build and avoid over-paramerizing. Over-parametrization may lead to non-convergence, but may also end up not being very useful for prediction/forecasting, which is one of the main objectives of stock assessment. data(ple4) data(ple4.indices) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices) stk &lt;- ple4 + fit plot(stk) By calling the fitted object the default submodel formulas are printed in the console: fit ## a4a model fit for: PLE ## ## Call: ## .local(stock = stock, indices = indices) ## ## Time used: ## Pre-processing Running a4a Post-processing Total ## 0.8380055 14.6720593 0.1772714 15.6873362 ## ## Submodels: ## fmodel: ~te(age, year, k = c(6, 30), bs = &quot;tp&quot;) + s(age, k = 6) ## srmodel: ~factor(year) ## n1model: ~s(age, k = 3) ## qmodel: ## BTS-Isis-early: ~s(age, k = 6) ## BTS-Combined (ISIS and TRIDENS): ~s(age, k = 6) ## SNS: ~s(age, k = 5) ## BTS-Combined (all): ~s(age, k = 6) ## IBTS_Q3: ~s(age, k = 6) ## IBTS_Q1: ~s(age, k = 5) ## vmodel: ## catch: ~s(age, k = 3) ## BTS-Isis-early: ~1 ## BTS-Combined (ISIS and TRIDENS): ~1 ## SNS: ~1 ## BTS-Combined (all): ~1 ## IBTS_Q3: ~1 ## IBTS_Q1: ~1 To set specific submodels the user has to write the relevant R formula and include it in the call. The arguments for each submodel are self-explanatory: fishing mortality is ‘fmodel’, indices’ catchability is ‘qmodel’, stock-recruitment is ‘srmodel’, observation variance is ‘vmodel’ and for initial year’s abundance is ‘n1model’. The following model comes closer to the official stock assessment of North Sea plaice, as such we’ll name it \\(0\\) and keep it for future comparisons: For future referencing we’ll start with a base fit to be used for future comparisons, named fit 0. fmod0 &lt;- ~s(age, k=6)+s(year, k=10)+te(age, year, k=c(3,8)) qmod0 &lt;- list(~s(age, k = 4), ~s(age, k = 3), ~s(age, k = 3)+year, ~s(age, k = 3), ~s(age, k = 4), ~s(age, k = 6)) srmod0 &lt;- ~ s(year, k=20) vmod0 &lt;- list(~s(age, k=4), ~1, ~1, ~1, ~1, ~1, ~1, ~1) n1mod0 &lt;- ~ s(age, k=3) fit0 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=fmod0, qmodel=qmod0, srmodel=srmod0, n1model=n1mod0, vmodel=vmod0) stk0 &lt;- ple4 + fit0 plot(stk0) As before by calling the fitted object submodels’ formulas are printed in the console: fit ## a4a model fit for: PLE ## ## Call: ## .local(stock = stock, indices = indices) ## ## Time used: ## Pre-processing Running a4a Post-processing Total ## 0.8380055 14.6720593 0.1772714 15.6873362 ## ## Submodels: ## fmodel: ~te(age, year, k = c(6, 30), bs = &quot;tp&quot;) + s(age, k = 6) ## srmodel: ~factor(year) ## n1model: ~s(age, k = 3) ## qmodel: ## BTS-Isis-early: ~s(age, k = 6) ## BTS-Combined (ISIS and TRIDENS): ~s(age, k = 6) ## SNS: ~s(age, k = 5) ## BTS-Combined (all): ~s(age, k = 6) ## IBTS_Q3: ~s(age, k = 6) ## IBTS_Q1: ~s(age, k = 5) ## vmodel: ## catch: ~s(age, k = 3) ## BTS-Isis-early: ~1 ## BTS-Combined (ISIS and TRIDENS): ~1 ## SNS: ~1 ## BTS-Combined (all): ~1 ## IBTS_Q3: ~1 ## IBTS_Q1: ~1 The method sca has other arguments which may be set by the user: [covar:] a `FLQuant} with covariates; [wkdir:] a folder (character) where the files will be saved for posterior inspection by the user; [verbose:] be more verbose (logical); [fit:] type of fit (character), ‘MP’ runs the minimizer without trying to invert the hessian and as such doesn’t return the covariance matrix of the parameters, normally used inside loops where parameter variance may not be relevant; ‘assessment’ runs minimizer and inverts hessian, returns the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters and the convergence criteria set in ; ‘MCMC’ runs ’s MCMC fit [center:] shall observations be centered before fitting (logical); [mcmc:] ’s MCMC arguments (character vector), must be paired with `fit=“MCMC”}. There are a set of methods for a4a fit objects which help manipulating sca() results, namely: [+:] update the stock object with the fitted fishing mortalities, population abundance and catch in numbers at age; 7.1 Fishing mortality submodel (\\(F_{ay}\\)) We will now take a look at some examples for \\(F\\) models and the forms that we can get. A non-separable model, where we consider age and year to interact can be modeled using a smooth interaction term in the F model using a tensor product of cubic splines with the te method (Figure 7.1), again borrowed from mgcv. fmod &lt;- ~ te(age, year, k = c(4,20)) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], fmod) wireframe(harvest(fit), zlab=&quot;F&quot;) Figure 7.1: Fishing mortality smoothed non-separable model In the last examples the fishing mortalities (Fs’) are linked across age and time. What if we want to free up a specific age class because in the residuals we see a consistent pattern. This can happen, for example, if the spatial distribution of juveniles is disconnected to the distribution of adults. The fishery focuses on the adult fish, and therefore the the F on young fish is a function of the distribution of the juveniles and could deserve a specific model. This can be achieved by adding a component for the year effect on age 1 (Figure 7.2). fmod &lt;- ~ te(age, year, k = c(4,20)) + s(year, k = 5, by = as.numeric(age==1)) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], fmod) wireframe(harvest(fit), zlab=&quot;F&quot;) Figure 7.2: Fishing mortality age-year interaction model with extra age 1 smoother. 7.1.1 Separable model One of the most useful models for fishing mortality is one in which ‘age’ and ‘year’ effects are independent, that is, where the shape of the selection pattern does not change over time, but the overall level of fishing mortality do. Commonly called a ‘separable model’. A full separable model in a4a is written using the factor function which converts age and year effects into categorical values, forcing a different coefficient to be estimated for each level of both effects. This model has age x year number of parameters. fmod1 &lt;- ~ factor(age) + factor(year) fit1 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=fmod1, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) One can reduce the number of parameters and add dependency along both effects, although still keeping independence of each other, by using smoothers rather than factor. We’ll use a (unpenalised) thin plate spline provided by package mgcv method s(). We’re using the North Sea Plaice data, and since it has 10 ages we will use a simple rule of thumb that the spline should have fewer than \\(\\frac{10}{2} = 5\\) degrees of freedom, and so we opt for 4 degrees of freedom. We will also do the same for year and model the change in \\(F\\) through time as a smoother with 20 degrees of freedom. fmod2 &lt;- ~ s(age, k=4) + s(year, k=20) fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=fmod2, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) An interesting extension of the separable model is the ‘double separable’ where a third factor or smoother is added for the cohort effect. fmod3 &lt;- ~ s(age, k=4) + s(year, k=20) + s(as.numeric(year-age), k=10) fit3 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=fmod3, fit=&quot;MP&quot;) ## Warning: *** ~s(age, k = 4) + s(year, k = 20) + s(as.numeric(year - age), k = 10) has 1 too many parameter(s)!! ## i will remove the redundant ones: ## s(as.numeric(year - age)).9 Figures 7.3 and 7.4 depicts the three models selectivities for each year. Each separable model has a single selectivity that changes it’s overall scale in each year, while the double separable introduces some variability over time by modeling the cohort factor. flqs &lt;- FLQuants(factor=harvest(fit1), smooth=harvest(fit2), double=harvest(fit3)) pset &lt;- list(strip.background=list(col=&quot;gray90&quot;)) xyplot(data~age|qname, groups=year, data=flqs, type=&quot;l&quot;, col=1, layout=c(3,1), ylab=&quot;fishing mortality&quot;, par.settings=pset) Figure 7.3: Selection pattern of separable models.

Independent age and year effects (factor), internally dependent age and year (smooth), double separable (double). 7.1.2 Constant selectivity for contiguous ages or years To set these models we’ll use the method replace() to define which ages or years will be modelled together with a single coefficient.

These methods can be used to create discrete time series, for which a different selection pattern is allowed in each block. This is called an interaction in statistical modelling parlance, and typically a * denotes an interaction term; for smoothers an interaction is achieved using the by argument. When this argument is a factor a replicate of the smooth is produced for each factor level. In the next case we’ll use the breakpts() to split the time series at 1990, although keeping the same shape in both periods, a thin plate spline with 3 knots (Figure 7.7). fmod &lt;- ~s(age, k = 3, by = breakpts(year, 1990)) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmod) Figure 7.7: F-at-age in two periods using in both cases a thin plate spline with 3 knots 7.1.4 Time changing selectivity In many cases, it may be desirable to allow the selection pattern to evolve over time, from year to year. Again there are several ways to do this, one way is to estimate a mean selection pattern, while also allowing F to vary over time for each age. This is like a seperate smoother over year, with ‘age blocks’ so, looking back at previous examples, we have: fmodel &lt;- ~ s(year, k = 15, by = factor(age)) + s(age, k = 4) This is a type of interaction between age and year, but the only connection (or correlation) across ages is via the smoother on age, however there are still 15 degrees of freedom for each age, so the model 5 x 15 + 4 = 69 degrees of freedom. To include correlation across ages and years together then the tensor product (te() function) is used, this has the effect of restricting the flexibility of the model for F. In the following, there is a smoother in 2 dimensions (age and year) where there is 5 degrees of freedom in the age direction, and 15 in the year dimension, resulting in a total of 5 x 15 = 65 degrees of freedom fmodel &lt;- ~ te(age, year, k = c(5, 15)) Often the above formulations provide too much flexibility, and a more complicated, but simpler model is preferable: fmodel &lt;- ~ s(age, k = 4) + s(year, k = 15) + te(age, year, k = c(3, 5)) in the above model, the main effects for age and year still have similar flexibility to the full tensor model, however, the interaction (or the change in F at age over time) has been restricted, so that the full model now has 4 + 15 + 3 x 5 = 34 degrees of freedom. 7.1.5 Trawl fleets} 7.1.6 Nets and Liners fleets} 7.1.7 Multigear fleets} 7.1.8 Trawl surveys} 7.1.9 Closed form selection pattern} One can use a closed form for the selection pattern. The only requirement is to be able to write it as a formula, the example below uses a logistic form. fmod &lt;- ~ I(1/(1+exp(-age))) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmod) wireframe(harvest(fit), zlab=&quot;F&quot;) Figure 7.8: F-at-age logistic 7.1.10 More models More complicated models can be built with these tools. For example, Figure 7.9 shows a model where the age effect is modelled as a smoother (the same thin plate spline) throughout years but independent from each other. fmod &lt;- ~ factor(age) + s(year, k=10, by = breakpts(age, c(2:8))) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmod) wireframe(harvest(fit), zlab=&quot;F&quot;) Figure 7.9: F-at-age as thin plate spline with 3 knots for each age A quite complex model that implements a cohort effect can be set through the following formula. Figure 7.10 shows the resulting fishing mortality. Note that in this case we end up with a variable F pattern over time, but rather than using 4 * 10 = 40 parameters, it uses, 4 + 10 + 10 = 24. fmodel &lt;- ~ s(age, k = 4) + s(pmax(year - age, 1957), k = 10) + s(year, k = 10) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=fmodel) Figure 7.10: F-at-age with a cohort effect. 7.2 Abundance indices catchability submodel (\\(Q_{ays}\\)) The catchability submodel is set up the same way as the \\(F\\) submodel and the tools available are the same. The only difference is that the submodel is set up as a list of formulas, where each formula relates with one abundance index. There’s no limitation in the number of indices or type that can be used for a fit. It’s the analyst that has to decide based on her/his expertise and knowledge of the stock and fleet dynamics. 7.2.1 Catchability submodel for age based indices A first model is simply a dummy effect on age, which means that a coefficient will be estimated for each age. Note that this kind of model considers that levels of the factor are independent (Figure 7.11). qmod &lt;- list(~factor(age)) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], qmodel=qmod) qhat &lt;- predict(fit)$qmodel[[1]] wireframe(qhat, zlab=&quot;q&quot;) Figure 7.11: Catchability age independent model If one considers catchability at a specific age to be dependent on catchability on the other ages, similar to a selectivity modelling approach, one option is to use a smoother at age, and let the data ‘speak’ regarding the shape (Figure 7.12). qmod &lt;- list(~ s(age, k=4)) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], qmodel=qmod) qhat &lt;- predict(fit)$qmodel[[1]] wireframe(qhat, zlab=&quot;q&quot;) Figure 7.12: Catchability smoother age model Finally, one may want to investigate a trend in catchability with time, very common in indices built from CPUE data. In the example given here we’ll use a linear trend in time, set up by a simple linear model (Figure 7.13). qmod &lt;- list( ~ s(age, k=4) + year) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], qmodel=qmod) qhat &lt;- predict(fit)$qmodel[[1]] wireframe(qhat, zlab=&quot;q&quot;) Figure 7.13: Catchability with a linear trend in year 7.2.2 Catchability submodel for age aggregated biomass indices} The previous section was focused on age disaggregated indices, but age aggregated indices (CPUE, biomass, DEPM, etc) may also be used to tune the total biomass of the population. In these cases a different class for the index must be used, the FLIndexBiomass, which uses a vector index with the age dimension called ‘all’. Note that in this case the qmodel should be set without age factors, although it can have a ‘year’ component and covariates if needed. An interesting feature with biomass indices is the age range they refer to can be specified. # simulating a biomass index (note the name of the first dimension element) using # the ple4 biomass and an arbritary catchability of 0.001 plus a lognormal error. dnms &lt;- list(age=&quot;all&quot;, year=range(ple4)[&quot;minyear&quot;]:range(ple4)[&quot;maxyear&quot;]) bioidx &lt;- FLIndexBiomass(FLQuant(NA, dimnames=dnms)) index(bioidx) &lt;- stock(ple4)*0.001 index(bioidx) &lt;- index(bioidx)*exp(rnorm(index(bioidx), sd=0.1)) range(bioidx)[c(&quot;startf&quot;,&quot;endf&quot;)] &lt;- c(0,0) # note the name of the first dimension element index(bioidx) ## An object of class &quot;FLQuant&quot; ## , , unit = unique, season = all, area = unique ## ## year ## age 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 ## all 457.77 416.55 463.96 456.24 595.30 491.48 618.92 615.75 535.50 ## year ## age 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 ## all 544.11 588.41 605.62 479.64 482.63 450.47 549.41 389.72 397.12 ## year ## age 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 ## all 499.46 426.30 517.21 477.54 394.84 508.28 439.09 497.83 690.11 ## year ## age 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 ## all 469.49 507.45 687.11 740.78 775.11 646.29 608.54 494.07 509.49 ## year ## age 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 ## all 378.78 324.46 375.33 313.34 404.40 391.12 393.03 401.83 394.92 ## year ## age 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 ## all 353.80 332.66 379.09 361.87 501.09 433.85 533.77 552.49 764.77 ## year ## age 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ## all 699.55 813.96 841.10 1076.01 988.39 875.03 977.31 ## ## units: t # fitting the model fit &lt;- sca(ple4, FLIndices(bioidx), qmodel=list(~1)) To estimate a constant selectivity over time one used the model \\(\\sim 1\\).

In this case the `FLIndex} object must have in the first dimension the age it referes to. The fit is then done relating the index with the proper age in numbers. Note that in this case the qmodel should be set without age factors, although it can have a ‘year’ component and covariates if needed. idx &lt;- ple4.indices[[1]][1] fit &lt;- sca(ple4, FLIndices(recidx=idx), qmodel=list(~1)) # the estimated catchability is predict(fit)$qmodel[[1]] ## An object of class &quot;FLQuant&quot; ## , , unit = unique, season = all, area = unique ## ## year ## age 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 ## 1 0.00030194 0.00030194 0.00030194 0.00030194 0.00030194 0.00030194 ## year ## age 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 ## 1 0.00030194 0.00030194 0.00030194 0.00030194 0.00030194 ## ## units: 7.3 Stock-recruitment submodel (\\(R_y\\))} The S/R submodel is a special case, in the sense that it can be set up with the same linear tools as the \\(F\\) and \\(Q\\) models, but it can also use some hard coded models. The example shows how to set up a simple dummy model with factor(), a smooth model with s(), a Ricker model (ricker()), a Beverton and Holt model (bevholt()), a hockey stick model (hockey()), and a geometric mean model (geomean()). See Figure 7.14 for results. As mentioned before, the ‘structural’ models have a fixed variance, which must be set by defining the coefficient of variation. srmod &lt;- ~ factor(year) fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=srmod) srmod &lt;- ~ s(year, k=10) fit1 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=srmod) srmod &lt;- ~ ricker(CV=0.05) fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=srmod) srmod &lt;- ~ bevholt(CV=0.05) fit3 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=srmod) srmod &lt;- ~ hockey(CV=0.05) fit4 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=srmod) srmod &lt;- ~ geomean(CV=0.05) fit5 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=srmod) flqs &lt;- FLQuants(factor=stock.n(fit)[1], smother=stock.n(fit1)[1], ricker=stock.n(fit2)[1], bevholt=stock.n(fit3)[1], hockey=stock.n(fit4)[1], geomean=stock.n(fit5)[1]) xyplot(data~year, groups=qname, data=flqs, type=&quot;l&quot;, auto.key=list(points=FALSE, lines=TRUE, columns=3), ylab=&quot;No. recruits&quot;) Figure 7.14: Stock-recruitment models fits 7.4 Observation variance submodel (\\(\\{\\sigma^2_{ay}, \\tau^2_{ays}\\}\\)) The variance model allows the user to set up the shape of the observation variances \\(\\sigma^2_{ay}\\) and \\(\\tau^2_{ays}\\). This is an important subject related with fisheries data used for input to stock assessment models. The defaults assume a U-shape model for catch-at-age and constant variance for abundance indices. The first relies on the fact that it’s common to have more precision on the most represented ages and less precision on the less frequent ages which tend to be the younger and older individuals. These sizes are less caught by the fleets and as such do not appear as often at the auction markets samples. With regards to the abundance indices, one assumes a scientific survey to have a well designed sampling scheme and protocols which keep observation error at similar levels across ages. vmod &lt;- list(~s(age, k=3), ~1) fit1 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], vmodel=vmod) vmod &lt;- list(~s(age, k=3), ~s(age, k=3)) fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], vmodel=vmod) Variance estimated for the constant model is 0.476 while for the U-shape model, fitted with a smoother, changes with ages (Figure 7.15). wireframe(predict(fit2)$vmodel[[2]], zlab=&quot;variance&quot;) Figure 7.15: Abundance index observation variance estimate Observation variance options have an impact in the final estimates of population abundance, which can be seen in Figure 7.16. flqs &lt;- FLQuants(smother=stock.n(fit1), factor=stock.n(fit2)) xyplot(data~year|age, groups=qname, data=flqs, type=&quot;l&quot;, scales=list(y=list(relation=&quot;free&quot;, draw=FALSE)), auto.key=list(points=FALSE, lines=TRUE, columns=2), par.settings=list(superpose.line=list(col=c(&quot;gray35&quot;, &quot;black&quot;)), strip.background=list(col=&quot;gray90&quot;)), ylab=&quot;&quot;) Figure 7.16: Population estimates using two different variance models 7.5 Initial year abundance submodel (\\(N_{a,y=1}\\))} The submodel for the stock number at age in the first year of the time series is set up with the usual modelling tools (Figure 7.17). Beare in mind that the year effect does not make sense here since it refers to a single year, the first in the time series of data available. This model has its influence limited to the initial lower triangle of the population matrix, which in assessments with long time series doesn’t make much difference. Nevertheless, when modelling stocks with short time series in relation to the number of ages present, it becomes more important and should be given proper attention. n1mod &lt;- ~s(age, k=3) fit1 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=fmod0, qmodel=qmod0, srmodel=srmod0, vmodel=vmod0, n1model=n1mod) n1mod &lt;- ~factor(age) fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, fmodel=fmod0, qmodel=qmod0, srmodel=srmod0, vmodel=vmod0, n1model=n1mod) flqs &lt;- FLQuants(smother=stock.n(fit1)[,1], factor=stock.n(fit2)[,1]) pset &lt;- list(superpose.line=list(col=c(&quot;gray50&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), lty=c(1,2))) xyplot(data~age, groups=qname, data=flqs, type=&quot;l&quot;, auto.key=lgnd, par.settings=pset, ylab=&quot;&quot;) Figure 7.17: Nay=1 models The impact in the overall perspective of the stock status is depicted in Figure 7.18.

However, the user may change these weights by penalizing data points, the \\(w_{ays}\\) in section ??. The likelihood score of each data point will be multiplied by the normalized weights (\\(\\sum w_{ays} = 1\\)). This is done by adding a variance matrix to the catch.n and index.n slots of the stock and index objects. The values should be given as coefficients of variation on the log scale, so that variance is \\(\\log{({CV}^2 + 1)}\\).

The same can be done in the a4a framework. The example below uses the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index to model recruitment. nao &lt;- read.table(&quot;https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/norm.nao.monthly.b5001.current.ascii.table&quot;, skip=1, fill=TRUE, na.strings=&quot;-99.90&quot;) dnms &lt;- list(quant=&quot;nao&quot;, year=1950:2024, unit=&quot;unique&quot;, season=1:12, area=&quot;unique&quot;) nao &lt;- FLQuant(unlist(nao[,-1]), dimnames=dnms, units=&quot;nao&quot;) nao &lt;- seasonMeans(trim(nao, year=dimnames(stock.n(ple4))$year)) First by simply assuming that the NAO index drives recruitment (Figure 7.21). srmod &lt;- ~ nao fit2 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices[1], qmodel=list(~s(age, k=4)), srmodel=srmod, covar=FLQuants(nao=nao)) flqs &lt;- FLQuants(simple=stock.n(fit)[1], covar=stock.n(fit2)[1]) Figure 7.21: Recruitment model with covariates.

When set up all the ADMB files will be left in the directory. Note that the ADMB tpl file is distributed with the FLa4a.

For sca() fits there are out-of-the-box methods to compute in the log scale, raw residuals (aka deviances), standardized residuals and pearson residuals. A set of plots to inspect residuals and evaluate fit quality and assumptions are implemented. Consider \\(x_{ay}\\) to be either a catch-at-age matrix (\\(C_{ay}\\)) or one abundance index (\\(I_{ay}\\)) and \\(d\\) to represent residuals. Raw residuals are compute by \\(d_{ay} = \\log{x_{ay}} - \\log{\\tilde{x}_{ay}}\\) and have distribution \\(N(0,\\upsilon^2_{a})\\). Standardized residuals will be compute with \\(d^s_{ay} = \\frac{d_{ay}}{\\hat{\\upsilon}^2_{a}}\\) where \\(\\hat{\\upsilon}^2_{a} = (n-1)^{-1} \\sum_y(d_{ay})^2\\). Pearson residuals scale raw residuals by the estimates of \\(\\sigma^2\\) or \\(\\tau^2\\), as such \\(d^p_{ay} = \\frac{d_{ay}}{\\tilde{\\upsilon}^2_{a}}\\) where \\(\\tilde{\\upsilon}^2_{a} = \\tilde{\\sigma}^2_{a}\\) for catches, or \\(\\tilde{\\upsilon}^2_{a} = \\tilde{\\tau}^2_{a}\\) for each index of abundance. The residuals() method will compute these residuals and generate a object which can be plotted using a set of packed methods. The argument type will allow the user to chose which residuals will be computed. By default the method computes standardized residuals. fit &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices) d_s &lt;- residuals(fit, ple4, ple4.indices) Figure 8.1 shows a scatterplot of standardized residuals with a smoother to guide (or mis-guide …) your visual analysis. Note that the standardization should produce residuals with variance=1, which means that most residual values should be between \\(\\sim -2\\) and \\(\\sim 2\\). plot(d_s) Figure 8.1: Standardized residuals for abundance indices and catch numbers (catch.n). Each panel is coded by age class, dots represent standardized residuals and lines a simple smoother. When plotting residuals by default the auxiliar line is a smoother. However it’s possible to use other type of lines by setting the argument “auxline” in plot. The argument can take the values used by xyplot, which are (from panel.xyplot help page) one or more of the following: “p”, “l”, “h”, “b”, “o”, “s”, “S”, “g”, “r”, “a”, “smooth”, and “spline”. If type has more than one element, an attempt is made to combine the effect of each of the components. The behaviour if any of the first five are included is similar to the effect of the corresponding type in plot: “p” and “l” stand for points and lines respectively; “b” and “o” (for ‘overlay’) plot both; “h” draws vertical (or horizontal if horizontal = TRUE) line segments from the points to the origin. Types “s” and “S” are like “l” in the sense that they join consecutive points, but instead of being joined by a straight line, points are connected by a vertical and a horizontal segment forming a ‘step’, with the vertical segment coming first for “s”, and the horizontal segment coming first for “S”. “g” adds a reference grid. Type “r” adds a linear regression line, “smooth” adds a loess fit, “spline” adds a cubic smoothing spline fit, and “a” draws line segments joining the average y value for each distinct x value. Figure 8.2 shows a regression line over the residuals instead of the loess smooother. plot(d_s, auxline=&quot;r&quot;) Figure 8.2: Standardized residuals for abundance indices and catch numbers (catch.n).

It shows the same information as Figure 8.1 but in a multivariate perspective. bubbles(d_s) Figure 8.3: Bubbles plot of standardized residuals for abundance indices and for catch numbers (catch.n).

Finally, the raw residuals are computed by setting fit='deviances' and plotted the same way as before (Figure 8.6). These residuals are usefull to identify which data points are not well modelled, showing a large dispersion of the residuals and requiring more attention from the analyst. d_r &lt;- residuals(fit, ple4, ple4.indices, type=&#39;deviances&#39;) plot(d_r) Figure 8.6: Raw residuals for abundance indices and catch numbers (catch.n).

The a4a framework implements a visualization of the fit’s predictive skill for both catch-at-age and abundance indices. These are generated by the method plot() with the fit object and a FLStock (Figure 8.7) or FLIndices (Figure ??) object as arguments. plot(fit, ple4) Figure 8.7: Predict and observed catch-at-age plot(fit, ple4.indices) Figure 8.8: Predict and observed abundance-at-age Figure 8.9: Predict and observed abundance-at-age Figure 8.10: Predict and observed abundance-at-age Figure 8.11: Predict and observed abundance-at-age Figure 8.12: Predict and observed abundance-at-age Figure 8.13: Predict and observed abundance-at-age 8.3 Aggreagted catch in weight} Although a statistical catch-at-age model assumes errors in catch-at-age and, as such, errors in the total catch in weight, there’s still interest to evaluate how close the model estimates are of the observed catch in weight1. The implementation of this diagnopstics is done through the method computeCatchDiagnostics(), which can be visualized with plot() (Figure @ref(c_d)). c_d &lt;- computeCatchDiagnostics(fit, ple4) plot(c_d) Figure 8.14: Diagnostics for age aggregated catch in weight 8.4 Fit summary, information and cross-validation metrics To get information about the likelihood fit the method fitSumm() can be used to report number of parameters (npar), negative log-likelkihood (nlogl), ADMB maximum gradient par (maxgrad), number of observations (nobs), generalized cross validation score (gcv), convergence flag (convergence) and acceptance rate (accrate) relevant for MCMC fits only.

Runs test checks weather the residuals are randomly distributed. A “run” is a sequence of the same sign residuals. Few runs indicate a trend or a correlation in the residuals while too many runs may suggest overfitting. The primary output of a runstest is a p-value where: a high p value \\((p\\leq 0.05)\\) suggests that the residuals are randomly distributed, a low p value indicates a non-random pattern in the residuals. library(a4adiags) theme_set(theme_bw()) fit &lt;- sca(mut09, mut09.idx, fmod = ~factor(age) + s(year, k = 8)) res &lt;- residuals(fit, mut09, mut09.idx) plotRunstest(fit, mut09.idx, combine = F) + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~age) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_rect, x$x, x$y, x$width, x$height, ## resolveHJust(x$just, : semi-transparency is not supported on this device: ## reported only once per page Figure 8.15: Runstest for the abundance index plotRunstest(catch.n(mut09), catch.n(mut09 + fit), combine = F) + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~age) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_rect, x$x, x$y, x$width, x$height, ## resolveHJust(x$just, : semi-transparency is not supported on this device: ## reported only once per page Figure 8.16: Runstest for the catch by age Green shading indicates no evidence \\((p &lt; 0.05)\\) and red shading evidence \\((p &gt;0.05)\\) to reject the hypothesis of a randomly distributed time-series of residuals, respectively. The shaded (green/red) area spans three residual standard deviations to either side from zero, and the red points outside of the shading violate the ‘\\(3\\sigma\\) limit’ for that series. 8.6 Residuals and submodels misspecifiction 8.6.1 The “mean” model To start the analysis we’ll fit a “mean” model, where all submodels will be set to an overall average, by using the \\(\\sim 1\\) formula. This will be our reference model to see how adding age and year effects will show up in the diagnostic tools, in particular in the residuals. data(hke1567) data(hke1567.idx) fit01 &lt;- sca(hke1567, hke1567.idx, fmod=~1, qmod=list(~1), srmod=~1, vmod=list(~1, ~1), n1mod=~1) res01 &lt;- residuals(fit01, hke1567, hke1567.idx) The common residuals plot clearly shows a trend across ages (Figure 8.18) for both datasets. plot(res01) Figure 8.17: Mean fit residuals by year) Which is even clearer when plotting the residuals by age across years. plot(res01, auxline=&quot;l&quot;, by=&quot;age&quot;) Figure 8.18: Mean fit residuals by age) 8.6.2 The age effects These models will introduce age effects in the fishing mortality submodel and catchability submodel.

The year trends are less pronounced although, because the data doesn’t have a very strong year effect, it’s less clear than when modelling the age effect. plot(res05) Figure 8.25: f year effect fit residuals by year) The residuals plot by age shows the same outcome. plot(res05, auxline=&quot;l&quot;, by=&quot;age&quot;) Figure 8.26: f year effect fit residuals by age) We can see now that the residuals show a lot less patterns than before. There’s still some issues, the survey catchability seems to have an year trend. However the model is not fully specified yet, stock recruitment is modelled as constant over time, the initial population abundance is also modelled as a constant as well as the variance models. 8.6.4 The initial year population abundance model, aka N1 This model will introduce an age effect in the population abundance in the first year of the time series. This model sets the n-at-age in the first year of the time series, which is needed due to the lack of previous data to reconstruct those cohorts. fit06 &lt;- sca(hke1567, hke1567.idx, fmod=~factor(age) + factor(year), qmod=list(~factor(age)), srmod=~1, vmod=list(~1, ~1), n1mod=~factor(age)) res06 &lt;- residuals(fit06, hke1567, hke1567.idx) The residuals plot now shows catch at age residuals stagered as before. The year trends are less pronounced although, because the data doesn’t have a very strong year effect, it’s less clear than when modelling the age effect. plot(res06) Figure 8.27: f year effect fit residuals by year) The residuals by age (Figure 8.28) the residuals’ improvement in the first year of the catch at age time series (bottom left plots). plot(res06, auxline=&quot;l&quot;, by=&quot;age&quot;) Figure 8.28: f year effect fit residuals by age) 8.6.5 The stock recruitment submodel In this example we’ll simply add a model to allow recruitment to vary over time and we’ll see how to track potential improvements in the residuals. fit07 &lt;- sca(hke1567, hke1567.idx, fmod=~factor(age) + factor(year), qmod=list(~factor(age)), srmod=~factor(year), vmod=list(~1, ~1), n1mod=~factor(age)) res07 &lt;- residuals(fit07, hke1567, hke1567.idx) The residuals plot by year are very useful to see the effect of adding a varying stock recruitment model. The year trends present in previous models are not absent. Recruitment variability when left unmodelled was being picked up by trends in the survey catchability and catch at age. And due to the cohort dynamics underlying the catch at age model, where propagating into other ages’ estimates. plot(res07) Figure 8.29: f year effect fit residuals by year) plot(res07, auxline=&quot;l&quot;, by=&quot;age&quot;) Figure 8.30: f year effect fit residuals by age) 8.6.6 The variance submodel Finally, we’re testing the variance submodel, specifically the catch at age variance model. We won’t dig into the catchability variance model though. It’s common to accept that a scientific survey following a well designed sampling protocol will have equal variance across ages since no preferential areas are sampled. fit10 &lt;- sca(hke1567, hke1567.idx, fmod=~factor(age) + s(year, k=10), qmod=list(~factor(age)), srmod=~s(year, k=10), vmod=list(~factor(age), ~1), n1mod=~factor(age)) res10 &lt;- residuals(fit10, hke1567, hke1567.idx) To see what’s happening with the variance model one can use predict to plot the different models fitted. flqs &lt;- FLQuants(mod10=predict(fit10)$vmodel$catch[,&quot;2022&quot;], mod07=predict(fit07)$vmodel$catch[,&quot;2022&quot;]) xyplot(data~age, data=flqs, group=qname, type=&quot;l&quot;, auto.key=T) Figure 8.31: Variance models for catch at age To see the effect these models have on the estimated quantities one can look at the variance of the estimates: flqs &lt;- FLQuants(mod10=catch.n(hke1567+simulate(fit10, nsim=500))[,&quot;2022&quot;], mod07=catch.n(hke1567+simulate(fit07, nsim=500))[,&quot;2022&quot;]) bwplot(data~qname|factor(age), data=as.data.frame(flqs), scales=&quot;free&quot;, auto.key=T) Figure 8.32: Estimates of population abundance with different variance models and the usual residuals plot(res10, auxline=&quot;r&quot;) Figure 8.33: f year effect fit residuals by year) plot(res10, auxline=&quot;l&quot;, by=&quot;age&quot;) Figure 8.34: f year effect fit residuals by age) Some analysts believe this is the most important diagnostic since total catch should be trusted. Needless to say we don’t agree and consider reported catch in weight one of the less reliable pieces of information available for stock assessment.↩︎ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
