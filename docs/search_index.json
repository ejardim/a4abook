For more information on the a4a methodologies refer to Jardim, et.al, 2014, Millar, et.al, 2014 and Scott, et.al, 2016. Documentation can be found at http://flr-project.org/FLa4a.

Some datasets are distributed with the package and as such need to be loaded too. # from CRAN install.packages(c(&quot;copula&quot;,&quot;triangle&quot;, &quot;coda&quot;, &quot;grid&quot;, &quot;gridExtra&quot;, &quot;latticeExtra&quot;)) # from FLR install.packages(c(&quot;FLCore&quot;, &quot;FLa4a&quot;), repos=&quot;http://flr-project.org/R&quot;) # libraries library(devtools) library(FLa4a) library(XML) library(reshape2) library(ggplotFL) # datasets data(ple4) data(ple4.indices) data(ple4.index) data(rfLen) packageVersion(&quot;FLCore&quot;) ## [1] &#39;2.6.20.920&#39; packageVersion(&quot;FLa4a&quot;) ## [1] &#39;1.9.0&#39; 1.3 How to read this document The target audience for this document are readers with some experience in R and some background on stock assessment. The document explains the approach being developed by for fish stock assessment and scientific advice. It presents a mixture of text and code, where the first explains the concepts behind the methods, while the last shows how these can be run with the software provided. Moreover, having the code allows the reader to copy/paste and replicate the analysis presented here. The sections and subsections are as independent as possible, so it can be used as a reference document for the FLa4a. 1.4 Notation Along this chapter the notation presented in Table 1.1 will be used. Mathematical descriptions will be kept as simple as possible for readability.
