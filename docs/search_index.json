According to their definition, “a forecast is an attempt to predict what will happen, whereas a projection describes what would happen, given certain hypotheses” (Massad et al., 2018). This distinction is also reflected in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2009), which notes that “forecasting” and “prediction” are often used interchangeably in assessing the magnitude that a given variable will assume in the future. In the context of economic and environmental modeling, the OECD distinguishes between medium-term projections, which typically extend five to six years into the future, and other predictive exercises that rely on different methodologies. The term “projection” is generally used in two interrelated senses: (1) as a future value of a time series computed based on specific assumptions about environmental changes, and (2) in probability theory, as the conditional expectation of a variable. Since regression models provide conditional expectations of dependent variables based on predictor variables, this probabilistic use of projection aligns with forecasting and predictive modeling (OECD, 2009). Applying this conceptual framework to fisheries science, the process of advising on future fishing opportunities can be viewed as a combination of forecasting and projection. When using a harvest control rule (HCR) approved by decision-makers to predict catch levels that can be extracted from a stock, the analysis falls into the realm of forecasting, as it predicts what will happen under known system conditions. Conversely, when assessing potential future outcomes based on predefined scenarios—such as climate change effects or policy interventions—the approach aligns more closely with projections. In fisheries science, the distinction between forecasting and prediction is not always explicitly made, with the discipline generally emphasizing broader predictive approaches. It is common practice to run scenarios when advising fisheries managers, testing different assumptions about future ecological and management conditions. Strictly speaking, projections are not part of the stock assessment process itself. Stock assessment concludes when analysts compare estimates of biomass and fishing mortality with reference points, allowing for determinations of whether a stock is overfished or subject to overfishing (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). Projections typically follow stock assessments, incorporating estimates or assumptions about population dynamics—growth, reproduction, and natural mortality—to predict future catches, biomass, and abundance under specific conditions and with quantified uncertainty. By integrating both forecasting and projection methodologies, fisheries science can offer robust, scenario-based decision-making tools that aid sustainable resource management (Punt et al., 2016). 12.0.1 References: Hilborn, R., &amp; Walters, C.

We’ll start by fitting a model including, a stock recruitment model which will be used to forecast recruitment. We’ll also set the number of iterations we’ll be working with and the time period we want to project. # fit model fit00 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=~geomean()) stk00 &lt;- ple4 + fit00 # create stock recruitment model object sr00 &lt;- as(fit00, &quot;FLSR&quot;) # set projection # number of iterations nsim &lt;- 250 # most recent year in the data maxy &lt;- range(ple4)[&quot;maxyear&quot;] # number of years to project projy &lt;- 5 # last year for projections endpy &lt;- maxy + projy # initial year for projections inipy &lt;- maxy + 1 # extend stock object to store projection&#39;s results stk00 &lt;- fwdWindow(stk00, end = endpy) # set the control for the projections, in this case a fixed f of 0.3 trg00 &lt;- fwdControl(year = inipy:endpy, quant = &quot;f&quot;, value = 0.3) # project stk01 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00) Figure 12.1: Projection of stock for 5 years with fixed fishing mortality and recruitment A natural addition to this forecast is to add uncertainty. We’ll do that by generating uncertainty in population numbers, catch numbers and fishing mortality, using simulate, and add stock recruitment uncertainty using the residuals of the fit. stk00 &lt;- ple4 + simulate(fit00, nsim) stk00 &lt;- fwdWindow(stk00, end = endpy) res00 &lt;- residuals(sr00) rec00 &lt;- window(rec(stk00), 2018, 2022) rec00 &lt;- rlnorm(rec00, mean(res00), sqrt(var(res00))) stk02 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00, residuals=rec00) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index): semi-transparency is ## not supported on this device: reported only once per page Figure 12.2: Stochastic projection of stock for 5 years with fixed fishing mortality and recruitment An alternative to the above workflow is to fit the stock recruitment model after the stock assessment model, using the output of the assessment as input to the stock recruitment fit. In which case stock recruitment estimation uncertainty can be added by fitting the stock recruitment model over stock assessment uncertainty, so that there will be stock-recruitment fit to each iteration generated from the stock assessment model. fit00 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices) stk00 &lt;- ple4 + simulate(fit00, nsim) sr00 &lt;- as.FLSR(stk00, model=&quot;geomean&quot;) sr00 &lt;- fmle(sr00, control = list(trace = 0)) stk00 &lt;- fwdWindow(stk00, end = endpy) res00 &lt;- residuals(sr00) rec00 &lt;- window(rec(stk00), inipy, endpy) rec00 &lt;- rlnorm(rec00, c(yearMeans(res00)), sqrt(c(yearVars(res00)))) stk03 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00, residuals=rec00) [IAGO, check rlnorm, it doesn’t work if the meanlog and sdlog are FLQuants] ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index): semi-transparency is ## not supported on this device: reported only once per page Figure 12.3: Stochastic projection of stock for 5 years with fixed fishing mortality and recruitment These two methods don’t give very different result when the stock recruitment model is not having a large impact in the other parameters.

The method fwdWindow has a set of options that allows the analyst to decide about those assumptions: wt: Number of years to average over to get the future mean weights at age, default is 3 mat: Number of years to average over to get the future proportion mature at age, default is 3 m: Number of years to average over to get the future natural mortality at age, default is 3 spwn: Number of years to average over to get the future fraction of mortality before spawning, default is 3 discards.ratio: Number of years to average over to get the future mean proportion of discards at age. Default is 3 catch.sel: Number of years to average over to get the future selection patern (fishing mortality at age which will be scaled based on canges in \\(\\bar{F}\\)). Default is 3 One can also define if those assumptions will be based on the mean value over the time period set, or randomly sampled from historical values, through setting the argument fun to mean or sample, respectively. For the next examples we’ll use the approach of fitting the stock recruitment within the assessment together with other parameters. We’ll set to 20 the number of years to compute mean weights at age, to 10 the number of years to average across and estimate the selection pattern in terms of fishing mortality at age. Finally, we’ll use a 10 year period to compute the average discard ratio. fit00 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=~geomean()) sr00 &lt;- as(fit00, &quot;FLSR&quot;) stk00 &lt;- ple4 + fit00 stk00 &lt;- fwdWindow(stk00, end = endpy, years = list(wt = 20, catch.sel = 10, discards.ratio = 10), fun = list(wt = &quot;sample&quot;)) trg00 &lt;- fwdControl(year = inipy:endpy, quant = &quot;f&quot;, value = 0.3) stk04 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index): semi-transparency is ## not supported on this device: reported only once per page Figure 12.5: Stochastic projections of stock for 5 years with fixed fishing mortality and recruitment. Two scenarios with different assumptions about initial conditions 12.3 Scenarios There’s a wide range of scenarios that can be of interest to project in order to give advice to policy makers, or to better understand the fitted stock assessment model. For example, projecting the stock in the absence of fishing for a few generations, gives good insights about the dynamics of the population being modelled. fit00 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=~geomean()) sr00 &lt;- as(fit00, &quot;FLSR&quot;) stk00 &lt;- ple4 + simulate(fit00, nsim) # set projection projy &lt;- 25 endpy &lt;- maxy + projy inipy &lt;- maxy + 1 stk00 &lt;- fwdWindow(stk00, end = endpy) trg00 &lt;- fwdControl(year = inipy:endpy, quant = &quot;f&quot;, value = 0) # recruitment uncertainty res00 &lt;- residuals(sr00) rec00 &lt;- window(rec(stk00), inipy, endpy) rec00 &lt;- rlnorm(rec00, mean(res00), sqrt(var(res00))) # project stk05 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00, residuals=rec00) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index): semi-transparency is ## not supported on this device: reported only once per page Figure 12.6: Stochastic projection of stock for 25 years in the absence of fishing These scenarios are defined by the target quantities one’s trying to achieve. In FLasher there are the following target quantities: - srp - ssb_end - biomass_end - ssb_spawn - biomass_spawn - ssb_flash - biomass_flash - inmb_end - indb - catch - landings - discards - f - fbar - revenue - effort [IAGO NEED YOUR HELP HERE] When projecting the stock under the conditions defined by the scenario one can mix several quantities. For example it may be interesting to project an initial situation of growing the stock followed by a higher exploitation to evaluate how catches would behave. trg00 &lt;- fwdControl(year = inipy:endpy, quant = c(rep(&quot;ssb_end&quot;, 15), rep(&quot;f&quot;, 10)), value = c(rep(2000000, 15), rep(0.3, 10))) stk06 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00, residuals=rec00) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index): semi-transparency is ## not supported on this device: reported only once per page Figure 12.7: Stochastic projection of stock for 25 years with fixed SSB for 15 years followed by fixed fishing mortality for 10 years and constant recruitment 12.3.1 Relative scenarios Another scenario that is very useful when advising decision makers is to have objectives which are relative to previous preformances. For example one could increase spwanwing stock biomass by 10% each year. This is done buy using the argument relYear and setting value in relative terms, \\(1.1\\). fit00 &lt;- sca(ple4, ple4.indices, srmodel=~geomean()) sr00 &lt;- as(fit00, &quot;FLSR&quot;) stk00 &lt;- ple4 + simulate(fit00, nsim) # set projection projy &lt;- 5 endpy &lt;- maxy + projy inipy &lt;- maxy + 1 stk00 &lt;- fwdWindow(stk00, end = endpy) trg00 &lt;- fwdControl(year = inipy:endpy, quant = &quot;ssb_end&quot;, value = 1.1, relYear = inipy:endpy-1) # recruitment uncertainty res00 &lt;- residuals(sr00) rec00 &lt;- window(rec(stk00), inipy, endpy) rec00 &lt;- rlnorm(rec00, mean(res00), sqrt(var(res00))) # project stk07 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00, residuals=rec00) Similar scenarios can be set for all quantities and any years to use as reference. The next example sets a scenario where \\(SSB\\) levels are set in relation to the most recent estimate out of the assessmeent. trg00 &lt;- fwdControl(year = inipy:endpy, quant = &quot;ssb_end&quot;, value = 1.1, relYear = maxy) stk08 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00, residuals=rec00) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index): semi-transparency is ## not supported on this device: reported only once per page Figure 12.8: Stochastic projection of stock for 25 years with fixed SSB for 15 years followed by fixed fishing mortality for 10 years and constant recruitment 12.3.2 Limits An important element when projecting the stock forward is to keep the performance of the fishery within some boundaries. A common one requested by the industry is to keep catches within some stability. fwd can include those constraints using the min and max arguments. The next example sets the minimum future catches to half of mean historical catches. minc &lt;- 0.2*mean(catch(stk00), na.rm=TRUE) trg00 &lt;- fwdControl(year = inipy:endpy, quant = rep(c(&quot;ssb_end&quot;, &quot;catch&quot;), projy), value = rep(c(1500000, NA), projy), min=rep(c(NA, minc), projy)) stk09 &lt;- fwd(stk00, control=trg00, sr=sr00, residuals=rec00) ## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_polygon, x$x, x$y, index): semi-transparency is ## not supported on this device: reported only once per page Figure 12.9: Stochastic projection of stock for 25 years with SSB target of 1500000t and catch limit of 50% historical catches 12.3.3 Complex scenario "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
