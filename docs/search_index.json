A forecast is an attempt to predict what will happen. A projection is an attempt to describe what would happen, given certain hypotheses [3].” (OECD) “Forecasting” and “prediction” are often used synonymously in the customary sense of assessing the magnitude which a quantity will assume at some future point of time . Medium-term projections or scenarios In the context of the OECD’s Economic Outlook, medium- term projections or scenarios look out five to six years, and are published as part of the OECD’s projection exercise. Projection This term is used in two connected senses. 1. In relation to a time series it means a future value calculated according to predetermined changes in the assumptions of the environment. 2. More recently, it has been used in probability theory to denote the conditional expectation of a variate. Since a regression equation gives the expectation of the dependent variate conditional upon values of the predicted (“independent”) variates and such equations are used for forecasting or prediction, the usages are connected. Considering the above definitions one can think of the process of advising future fishing opportunities as a mix of forecasting and projections. When using a HCR that is accepted by decision makers to predict the catches which can be taken from the stock, one’s in forecasting space. The process will retur what will happen having into account the known conditions of the system. On the other hand, when exploring potential future outcomes based on a set of scenarios previously defined, one’s much more in projection’s space. In fisheries science it’s not common to make the distinction between forecasts and predictions, and, in general, the approach tends to be much more within the realm of predictions. For example, it’s common to run scenarios when giving advice to fisheries managers or test different assumptions about future events. Strickly speaking projections are not part of the stock assessment process. The assessment of the status of the stock is completed when the analysts produces a comparison between the estimates of biomass and fishing mortality and the respective reference points. At that point it’s possible to make statements about the stock being overfished, or not, and being subject to overfishing, or not. Projections tend to come after having estimates of abundance or biomass and fishing mortality. Together with estimates, or assumptions, about the population’s dynamics: growth, reproduction, natural mortality, etc; one can predict catches, biomass, abundance and other relevant statistics, under spoecific conditions and with a certain level of uncertainty. For this section we’ll be using the package FLasher (REF) from the FLR family of packages. Starting by fitting a model including a stock recruitment model. For projections one needs to set future recruitment. ## Loading required package: FLCore ## Loading required package: lattice ## Loading required package: iterators ## FLCore (Version 2.6.20.9302, packaged: 2024-11-11 13:05:29 UTC) ## Loading required package: triangle ## This is FLa4a 1.9.0.

We’ll do that by generating uncertainty in population numbers, catch numbers and fishing mortality, using simulate. And add stock recruitment uncertinaty, combining observation and parameter uncertainty. The first using the residuals of the fit and the latter by fitting the stock recruitment models to the iterations simulated in the previous step, which creates an empirical distribution of the stock recruitment parameters, similar to a boot strap process. stk0 &lt;- ple4 + simulate(fit0, 250) recr &lt;- residuals(sr0) stk &lt;- stf(stk0, nyears=5) recs &lt;- window(rec(stk), 2018, 2022) recs &lt;- rlnorm(recs, mean(recr), sqrt(var(recr) + vcov(sr0))) stk &lt;- fwd(stk, control=trg, sr=sr0, residuals=recs) Figure 15.2: Stochastic projection of stock for 5 years with fixed fishing mortality and recruitment 15.1 Initial condition assumptions When projecting the stock forward one needs to make a number of assumptions about initial conditions, the starting point from where projections will be made. The method stf has a set of options that allows the analyst to decide about those assumptions. wts.nyears: Number of years to average over to get the future mean weights at age, default is 3 fbar.nyears: Number of years to average the F over, default is 3 f.rescale: Rescale F to most recent F estimate, default is FALSE arith.mean: If TRUE the arithmetic mean is used. If FALSE the geometric mean is used. Default is TRUE. disc.nyears: Number of years to average over to get the future mean proportion of discards at age.

Two scenarios with different assumptions about initial conditions 15.2 Scenarios There’s a wide range of scenarios that can be of interest to project in order to give advice to policy makers, or to better understand the fitted stock assessment model. For example, forecasting the stock in the absence of fishing for a few generations, gives good insights about the dynamics of the population being modelled. stk &lt;- stf(stk0, nyears=25) recs &lt;- window(rec(stk), 2018, range(stk)[&quot;maxyear&quot;]) recs &lt;- rlnorm(recs, mean(recr), sqrt(var(recr) + vcov(sr0))) trg &lt;- fwdControl(year = 2018:range(stk)[&quot;maxyear&quot;], quant = &quot;f&quot;, value = 0) stk &lt;- fwd(stk, control=trg, sr=sr0, residuals=recs) Figure 15.4: Stochastic projection of stock for 25 years with fixed fishing mortality and recruitment These scenarios are defined by the target quantities one’s trying to achieve. In FLasher there are the following target quantities: - srp - ssb_end - biomass_end - ssb_spawn - biomass_spawn - ssb_flash - biomass_flash - inmb_end - indb - catch - landings - discards - f - fbar - revenue - effort [IAGO NEED YOUR HELP HERE] When projecting the stock under the conditions defined by the scenario one can mix several quantities. For example it may be interesting to project an initial situation of growing the stock forward by a higher exploitation to evaluate how catches would behave. Since we’re going to increase SSB let’s use a beverton and holt recruitment model to introduce more structure in teh model. trg &lt;- fwdControl(year = 2018:range(stk)[&quot;maxyear&quot;], quant = c(rep(&quot;ssb_end&quot;, 15), rep(&quot;f&quot;, 10)), value = c(rep(1500000, 15), rep(0.3, 10))) stk &lt;- fwd(stk, control=trg, sr=sr0, residuals=recs) ## Warning in .local(object, fishery, control, ...): Unsolved targets at control ## rows: 1, 3, 5, 9, 7, 13, 27, 11, 19, 29, 25, 21, 23, 17, 15 Figure 15.5: Stochastic projection of stock for 25 years with fixed SSB for 15 years followed by fixed fishing mortality for 10 years and constant recruitment "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
