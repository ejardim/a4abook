# Stock assessment framework

## Maths description \label{sec:math}

### Observations

The stock assessment model is based on two types of observations: catches, $\hat{C}$, and abundance indices, $\hat{I}$. The model predicts catches at age $C_{ay}$ and indices of abundance $I_{ays}$ for each age $a$, year $y$ and survey $s$ in the input dataset. It is assumed that the observed catches are normally distributed about the model predictions on the log scale with observation variance $\sigma^2_{ay}$. that is:

\begin{equation}
  \log \hat{C}_{ay} \sim \text{Normal} \Big( \log C_{ay}, \sigma^2_{ay}\Big)
\end{equation}

likewise, the observed survey indices are assumed to be normally distributed about the model predictions on the log scale with observation variance $\tau^2_{ays}$:

\begin{equation}
\log \hat{I}_{ays} \sim \text{Normal} \Big( \log I_{ays}, \tau^2_{ays} \Big)
\end{equation}

This leads to the definition of the log-likelihood of the observed catches

\begin{equation}
\ell_C = \sum_{ay} w^{(c)}_{ay}\ \ell_N \Big( \log C_{ay}, \sigma^2_{ay} ;\ \log \hat{C}_{ay} \Big)
\end{equation}


and the log-likelihood of the observed survey indices

\begin{equation}
\ell_I = \sum_s \sum_{ay} w^{(s)}_{ays}\ \ell_N \Big( \log I_{ays}, \tau_{ays}^2 ;\ \log \hat{I}_{ays} \Big)
\end{equation}


where $\ell_N$ is the normal log-likelihood function and $w^{(c)}_{ay}$ and $w^{(s)}_{ays}$ are optional weights for the catch and index observations, respectively. The total log-likelihood is then

\begin{equation}
\ell = \ell_C + \ell_I
\end{equation}


### The population dynamics model

To predict catches and survey indices, the model uses the standard population dynamics model

\begin{equation}
N_{a+1,y+1} = N_{ay} \exp \left( - F_{ay} - M_{ay} \right)
\end{equation}


where $N_{ay}$ is the number of individuals at age $a$ in year $y$, $F_{ay}$ is the fishing mortality at age $a$ in year $y$, and $M_{ay}$ is the natural mortality at age $a$ in year $y$.  Any fish that survived beyond the oldest age $A$ in the model are accumulated in the oldest age group and are assumed to be fished at a common rate $F_{A,y}$.


\begin{align}
N_{A,y+1} = &N_{A-1,y} \exp \left( - F_{A-1,y} - M_{A-1,y} \right) \\
            &+ N_{A,y} \exp \left( - F_{A,y} - M_{A,y} \right)
\end{align}


The numbers $N_{a,y}$ are initiated in the first year, $y=1$ and at the youngest age, $a=1$, and the matrix of numbers at age are filled in according to the population dynamics model stated above (see Figure \@ref(fig:popdyn)).

```{r, popdyn, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Statistical catch at age population dynamics model", echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/sca_matrix.png")
```

Defining $R_y = N_{1,y}$, the numbers at age can be written (ignoring the plus group) as:

\begin{equation}
N_{a,y} = \left\{ \begin{matrix} R_{y-a+1} \exp \left( - \sum^a_{i=1} F_{a-i,y-i} + M_{a-i,y-i} \right) &  y \geq a \\ N_{a-y+1,1} \exp \left( - \sum^{a-y}_{i=1} F_{a-i,y-i} + M_{a-i,y-i} \right) &  y \lt a \end{matrix} \right.
\end{equation}


Catches in numbers by age and year are defined in terms of the three quantities: natural mortality, fishing mortality and recruitment; using a modified form of the well known Baranov catch equation:

\begin{equation}
C_{ay} = \frac{F_{ay}}{F_{ay}+M_{ay}}\left(1 - e^{-(F_{ay}+M_{ay})}\right) R_{y}e^{-\sum (F_{ay} + M_{ay})}
\end{equation}


Survey indices by age and year are defined in terms of the same three quantities with the addition of survey catchability:

\begin{equation}
I_{ays} = Q_{ays} R_{y}e^{-\sum (F_{ay} + M_{ay})}
\end{equation}


Observed catches and observed survey indices are assumed to be log-normally distributed, or equivalently, normally distributed on the log-scale, with specific observation variance:

\begin{equation}
\log \hat{C}_{ay} \sim \text{Normal} \Big( \log C_{ay}, \sigma^2_{ay}\Big)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\log \hat{I}_{ays} \sim \text{Normal} \Big( \log I_{ays}, \tau^2_{ays} \Big)
\end{equation}


The log-likelihood can now be defined as the sum of the log-likelihood of the observed catches:

\begin{equation}
\ell_C = \sum_{ay} w^{(c)}_{ay}\ \ell_N \Big( \log C_{ay}, \sigma^2_{ay} ;\ \log \hat{C}_{ay} \Big)
\end{equation}


and the log-likelihood of the observed survey indices as:

\begin{equation}
\ell_I = \sum_s \sum_{ay} w^{(s)}_{ays}\ \ell_N \Big( \log I_{ays}, \tau_{ays}^2 ;\ \log \hat{I}_{ays} \Big)
\end{equation}


giving the total log-likelihood

\begin{equation}
\ell = \ell_C + \ell_I
\end{equation}


which is defined in terms of the strictly positive quantites, $M_{ay}$, $F_{ay}$, $Q_{ays}$ and $R_{y}$, and the observation variances $\sigma_{ay}$ and $\tau_{ays}$. As such, the log-likelihood is over-parameterised as there are many more parameters than observations. In order to reduce the number of parameters, $M_{ay}$ is assumed known (as is common).

The remaining parameters are written in terms of a linear combination of covariates $x_{ayk}$, e.g.

\begin{equation}
\log F_{ay} = \sum_k \beta_k x_{ayk}
\end{equation}


where $k$ is the number of parameters to be estimated and is sufficiently small. Using this tecnique the quantities $\log F$, $\log Q$, $\log \sigma$ and $\log \tau$
%$\log \text{initial\,age\,structure}$ % this is not present in the above
(in bold in the equations above) can be described by a reduced number of parameters. The following section has more discussion on the use of linear models in a4a.

The a4a statistical catch-at-age model can addionally allow for a functional relationship that links predicted recruitment $\tilde{R}$ based on spawning stock biomass and modelled recruitment $R$, to be imposed as a fixed variance random effect. [NEEDS REVISION, sentence not clear]

Options for the relationship are the hard coded models Ricker, Beverton Holt, smooth hockeystick or geometric mean. This is implemented by including a third component in the log-likelihood:

\begin{equation}
\ell_{SR} = \sum_y \ell_N \Big( \log \tilde{R}_y(a, b), \phi_y^2 ;\ \log R_y \Big)
\end{equation}


giving the total log-likelihood

\begin{equation}
\ell = \ell_C + \ell_I + \ell_{SR}
\end{equation}


Using the (time varying) Ricker model as an example, predicted recruitment is

\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}_y(a_y,b_y) = a_y S_{y-1} e^{-b_y S_{y-1}}
\end{equation}


where $S$ is spawning stock biomass derived from the model parameters $F$ and $R$, and the fixed quantites $M$ and mean weights by year and age. It is assumed that $R$ is log-normally distributed, or equivalently, normally distributed on the log-scale about the (log) recruitment predicted by the SR model $\tilde{R}$, with known variance $\phi^2$, i.e.

\begin{equation}
\log R_y \sim \text{Normal} \Big( \log \tilde{R}_y, \phi_y^2 \Big)
\end{equation}


which leads to the definition of $\ell_{SR}$ given above. In all cases $a$ and $b$ are strictly positive, and with the quantities $F$, $R$, etc. linear models are used to parameterise $\log a$ and/or $\log b$, where relevant.

By default, recruitment $R$ as apposed to the reruitment predicted from a stock recruitment model $\tilde{R}$, is specified as a linear model with a parameter for each year, i.e.

\begin{equation}
\log R_y = \gamma_y
\end{equation}


This is to allow modelled recruitment $R_y$ to be shrunk towards the stock recruitment model. However, if it is considered appropriate that recruitment can be determined exactly by a relationship with covariates, it is possible, to instead define $\log R$ in terms of a linear model in the same way as $\log F$, $\log Q$, $\log \sigma$ and $\log \tau$.  %But this is pretty much the same as taking a geometric mean, with a model on log a, and making the variance very small.

## Classes Description \label{sec:classes}

The data structure used to store and report the fitting process follows an object-oriented paradigm (e.g., the S4 system in R) and is hierarchically organized. The `type` argument in the `sca` method defines the fitting method—either maximum likelihood or MCMC — and specifies whether the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters is calculated and returned in the case of maximum likelihood. The resulting object belongs to a specific class, depending on the selected option. Figure \@ref(fig:iomod) illustrates the input/output model of the statistical stock assessment method based on catch-at-age data.

Table \@ref(tab:scatype) provides details about the type of fit approach and computation of variance covariance information.

|Type of Fit|Fit Method|Variance-Covariance Matrix|Output Object Class|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|MP|Maximum Likelihood|No|`a4aFit`|
|Assessment|Maximum Likelihood|Yes|`a4aFitSA`|
|MCMC|MCMC|Yes(check)|`a4aFitMCMC`|
Table: (\#tab:scatype) Fit Types and Associated Classes

Type `MP`, for "Management Procedure," returns an `a4aFit` class object designed for use in MSEs (Management Strategy Evaluations) with full feedback models (REF PUNT and KELL). Inverting the Jacobian to compute the variance-covariance matrix is computationally intensive in maximum likelihood models, and as MSE analyses often involve thousands of iterations, using `type="MP"` significantly speeds up the process. This option is advantageous for scenarios requiring multiple model fits. However, the lack of immediate feedback on model convergence is a drawback, as convergence is assessed by inverting the Jacobian. A failed inversion indicates non-convergence. Table \@ref(tab:a4afitclass) describes the composition of the `a4aFit` class.
